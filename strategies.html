<h2>Suspicion Strategies</h2>

<h2>Response Strategies</h2>

<h2>Accusation Strategies</h2>
<p>There are several strategies that can be used to determine whether to make an accusation. the first is obvious one. The second is an alternative strategy that can be played by winning-driven agents. This is one we encountered while playing.</p>

<h3>Default Accusation Strategy</h3>
<p>If you know all the cards that are in the envelope (be eliminating all other possibilities), make an accusation containing those cards.</p>

<h3>Risky Accusation Strategy</h3>
<p>It can happen that you know all the cards in the envelope, except for one. So of one of the categories you still hold 2 different cards for possible. If you make an accusation then, you can lose if you choose the wrong card. However, if you are that far in the game, another agent might be too, and all other agents have a chance to make an accusation before your turn comes again. If they are correct, you also lose. so in this situation, it could be a good strategy to guess the card.</p>
