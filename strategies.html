<h1>Strategies and Situations</h1>

<h2>Suspicion Strategies</h2>



<h2>Response Strategies</h2>

<h2>Accusation Strategies</h2>
<p>There are several strategies that can be used to determine whether to make an accusation. the first is obvious one. The second is an alternative strategy that can be played by winning-driven agents. This is one we encountered while playing.</p>

<h3>Default Accusation Strategy</h3>
<p>If you know all the cards that are in the envelope (be eliminating all other possibilities), make an accusation containing those cards.</p>

<h3>Risky Accusation Strategy</h3>
<p>It can happen that you know all the cards in the envelope, except for one. So of one of the categories you still hold 2 different cards for possible. If you make an accusation then, you can lose if you choose the wrong card. However, if you are that far in the game, another agent might be too, and all other agents have a chance to make an accusation before your turn comes again. If they are correct, you also lose. so in this situation, it could be a good strategy to guess the card.</p>


<h2>Other Situations</h2>

<h3>Using one's own cards in a Suspicion</h3>
<p>Initially we wanted to implement a strategy in which an agent uses their own cards in a suspicion. For example, if agent A holds the candlestick, they could make a suspicion with Mrs. White and the candlestick. One would do this to try to gain information specifically on Mrs. White. While playing the game ourselves we all used this strategy. However, it is not rational. It is defendable that we use it, but, as also described by H. van Ditmarsch in his thesis 'Knowledge Games' (2000), we only use it because humans have a limited processing capability and limited short-term memory.</p>
<p>This means that we cannot hold the entire model of possible states and knowledge in our heads, and therefore try to limit the number of possible states. As the system we built is capable of computing the entire model (for a smaller number of categories), we did not implement this strategy. Perfect epistemic logicians would not play this, but would inquire after that which they know least about. </p>
