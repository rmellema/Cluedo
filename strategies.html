<h1>Strategies and Situations</h1>
<p>Most of the strategies that can be played (as described below) originated from situations we encountered while playing the game ourselves, and from reasoning about possible tactics and other situations.</p>

<h2>Suspicion Strategies</h2>
<p>There are two strategies that can be used to determine which suspicion an agent could/should make when they get their turn. We named the first the 'default' strategy, and the second the 'complex' strategy.</p>

<h3>Default Suspicion Strategy</h3>
<p>A very simple strategy: the agent chooses a card per category of which they do not know whether it is in the envelope, and then make that set their suspicion.</p>

<h3>Complex Suspicion Strategy</h3>
<p>A more complex suspicion stratgy is to take into account the information of the other players. To do this, an agent first makes a list per category of the cards it does not yet know. Instead of just choosing one from this list, they check to see how many agents know something about that card. If agent A knows that agent I knows that card is in the envelope, or that agent I knows that card is held by agent A, that is seen as 'knowing something about that card'. If the other agent already knows something about these cards, they can gain more information if there are cards shown by an agent who has to respond to the suspicion. </p>
<p>An example: Agent A suspects Mrs. White and the candlestick. However, I know that agent A has Mrs. White, because they showed me that card in a previous round. Agent B, who is asked to respond to the suspicion, shows agent A a card. Because I know that Agent B cannot have Mrs. White (because I know Agent A has it), the card shown must be the candlestick. In the game of cluedo the goal is to gain as much information as possible, while giving the other agents the least possible information. So, if it can be avoided, any agent wants to play the strategy that will give them new information, without giving more information than necessary to the other agents.</p>

<h2>Response Strategies</h2>
<p>If another player makes a suspicion, an agent can be asked to respond to
that query. This means that if the agent has one or more of the cards queried,
they must show one of them. In all cases, if an agent only has one of the cards in the suspicion, they have to show that one. When they have more than one, there are different strategies that can be played. </p>

<h3>Default Response Strategy</h3>
<p>The simplest strategy that can be played is just to choose a card from the suspicion to return at random. If the agent only has one, this is easy, and otherwise, they choose one at random.</p>


<h3>Simple Response Strategy</h3>
<p>A slightly more complicated strategy is to check whether you have already shown one of the cards to the querying agent. If you have (if you know that they know that you have that card), then just show that card again, that gives then no new information at all. If the agent hasn't shown any of the cards to the querying agent, then just choose a random card.</p>

<h3>Optimal Response Strategy</h3>
<p>This can be added on to the simple strategy, so if the agent has more than one of the cards in the suspicion, and has shown neither of them to the other agent before. In this case, you still want the opponent to gain the least amount of information. A way to do this is to reason about how many information showing each of these cards would give the other agent. If you know that they know almost all weapon cards, you would be better off to show a person card. However, if there are six possible weapons and four possible suspects, and you know that they know half of each category, it is better to show a weapon, because that gives the least amount of information, relatively.</p>


<h2>Accusation Strategies</h2>
<p>There are several strategies that can be used to determine whether to make an accusation. the first is obvious one. The second is an alternative strategy that can be played by winning-driven agents. This is one we encountered while playing.</p>

<h3>Default Accusation Strategy</h3>
<p>If you know all the cards that are in the envelope (be eliminating all other possibilities), make an accusation containing those cards.</p>

<h3>Risky Accusation Strategy</h3>
<p>It can happen that you know all the cards in the envelope, except for one. So of one of the categories you still hold 2 different cards for possible. If you make an accusation then, you can lose if you choose the wrong card. However, if you are that far in the game, another agent might be too, and all other agents have a chance to make an accusation before your turn comes again. If they are correct, you also lose. so in this situation, it could be a good strategy to guess the card.</p>


<h2>Other Situations</h2>

<h3>Using one's own cards in a Suspicion</h3>
<p>Initially we wanted to implement a strategy in which an agent uses their own cards in a suspicion. For example, if agent A holds the candlestick, they could make a suspicion with Mrs. White and the candlestick. One would do this to try to gain information specifically on Mrs. White. While playing the game ourselves we all used this strategy. However, it is not rational. It is defendable that we use it, but, as also described by H. van Ditmarsch in his thesis 'Knowledge Games' (2000), we only use it because humans have a limited processing capability and limited short-term memory.</p>
<p>This means that we cannot hold the entire model of possible states and knowledge in our heads, and therefore try to limit the number of possible states. As the system we built is capable of computing the entire model (for a smaller number of categories), we did not implement this strategy. Perfect epistemic logicians would not play this, but would inquire after that which they know least about. </p>
