Cluedo
------

cluedo outline and rules

actions:
	+ suspect (nothing can be deduced from a suspicion bij agent a)
	+ noshow (Common knowledge that agent b does not have any of the cards)
	+ show (common knowledge that agent c has at least one of the cards, and knowledge of that card for a and c)
	+ nowin (public announcement that you do not have enough information to win, that you do not know which cards are in the envelope)
	+ accuse (nothing can be learned from the accusation)
	+ check (the checking of the accusation either lets an agent win or lose, but because the accusation was hidden, no other agents learn anything)
	+ announce (in play with human agents, announcements can be made giving information about the game. As we only have perfect epistemic logicians, this is not relevant for us).

win: if in all worlds accessible to you, the table 'holds' the same three cards (or one per category).

perfect logicians in cluedo:
	+ when humans play they are not perfect epistemic logicians, they have a limited capacity, and may forget something that was said. Also, they are fallible, so can make a mistake.

### Strategies 
possible rational strategies in cluedo are:
	+ list

Logic
-----

Logica uitleg die we gebruiken. Assume reflexive access for all worlds for all agents. Announcements, public and private. 

simplifications in model: alleen om de kennis, niet het bord. Daarmee verlies je wel iets aan complexiteit, maar acties mappen naar announcements.

actions in announcements:
	+ noshow (public announcement that b does not have any of the cards)
	+ show (public announcement that c has at least one of the cards, private announcement from c to a of one card)
	+ nowin (public announcemnet that d does not have enough information to win)

Verwijzen naar de relaties die we gebruiken en uitleggen waarom het mag zoals we het doen.

Cluedo hard to compute (bron: Kooi, Master(s)mind(s), manuscript 2000). Uitleg cluedo als logica (bron: van Ditmarsch, Knowledge games, 2000).

Waarom geen learning en beliefs? Waarom geen action frames.

unsuccesful updates (optional?):
	+ uitleg
	+ relevantie
	+ toepassingen

vD00 cocludes that:
 	+ it is unclear what the personal prefences of a player are
 		- comparison of new possible game states
 		- (recursive) analysis of the questions that the next player can ask
 	+ it is unclear what the mixed strategy equilibria are
