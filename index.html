<p>For this project, we implemented a dynamic epistemic modelling tool for a
simplified version of Cluedo. This tool is able to check formulas from Public
Announcement Logic in a specific Kripke model, which is built specifically for
Cluedo. This tool can be used to analyse specific situations and strategies in
Cluedo. The current version of the tool can be downloaded <a
  href="https://github.com/rmellema/Cluedo/releases/tag/V0.1">here</a>. </p>

<h2>Simplification</h2> 
<p>Because implementing the full scope of Cluedo would be too complex to check
formulas in a reasonable amount of time, we decided to simplify our version of
Cluedo to a game with only six weapons, four persons, and no rooms. This means
that there are only four agents (players) who have two cards each. Because we
use two categories, there are only two cards in the envelope, instead of the
usual three. Since we are only interested in the reasoning within this game and
movement has little influence on this, we left it out of our implementation.</p>

<h2>Private Announcements</h2>
<p>Since Cluedo also uses private announcements beside public announcements, we
also had to implement those. We implemented private announcements as the
removal of relations for an agent between states if those states have different
truth values for the announcement and the announcement is made to that agent.
We have a proof that this method gives us the correct knowledge change <a

<h1>Results</h1> 
<p>As we do not have any complex strategies implemented, and only one strategy
of each yet, we cannot give any results. </p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>As we have no results yet, we cannot conclude anything.</p>
